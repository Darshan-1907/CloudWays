<br><p>Mobile Cloud Computing 
<br>
1) Introduction :- Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is the combination of cloud computing and mobile computing to bring rich computational resources to mobile users, network operators, as well as cloud computing providers. The ultimate goal of MCC is to enable execution of rich mobile applications on a plethora of mobile devices, with a rich user experience.MCC provides business opportunities for mobile network operators as well as cloud providers.More comprehensively, MCC can be defined as "a rich mobile computing technology that leverages unified elastic resources of varied clouds and network technologies toward unrestricted functionality, storage, and mobility to serve a multitude of mobile devices anywhere, anytime through the channel of Ethernet or Internet regardless of heterogeneous environments and platforms based on the pay-as-you-use principle."<br>
2) Architechture :- MCC uses computational augmentation approaches (computations are executed remotely instead of on the device) by which resource-constraint mobile devices can utilize computational resources of varied cloud-based resources.In MCC, there are four types of cloud-based resources, namely distant immobile clouds, proximate immobile computing entities, proximate mobile computing entities, and hybrid (combination of the other three model).[2][5] Giant clouds such as Amazon EC2 are in the distant immobile groups whereas cloudlet or surrogates are member of proximate immobile computing entities. Smartphones, tablets, handheld devices, and wearable computing devices are part of the third group of cloud-based resources which is proximate mobile computing entities.<br>
<br>
Vodafone,[9] Orange and Verizon have started to offer cloud computing services for companies.<br>
3) Advantages :- Mobile Cloud Computing saves Business money.<br>
Because of the portability which makes their work easy and efficient.<br>
Cloud consumers explore more features on their mobile phones.<br>
Developers reach greater markets through mobile cloud web services.<br>
More network providers can join up in this field.<br>
 4) Limitations :-  Low bandwidth: This is one of the big issues in mobile cloud computing. Mobile cloud use radio waves which are limited as compared to wired networks. Available wavelength is distributed in different mobile devices. Therefore, it has been three times slower in accessing speed as compared to a wired network.<br>
Security and Privacy: It is difficult to identify ad manage threats on mobile devices as compared to desktop devices because in a wireless network there are more chances of the absence of the information from the network.<br>
Service Availability: Users often find complaints like a breakdown of the network, transportation crowding, out of coverage, etc. Sometimes customers get a low-frequency signal, which affects the access speed and storage facility.
5) Applications :- There are two types of applications of mobile cloud computing (MCC) that are almost similar. These are as follows: <br>
<br>
1. Mobile Cloud application: It is defined as a model where processing is done in the cloud, and the storage is also in the cloud, and the presentation platform is the mobile device. For this, the internet connection should have to reliable and cell-phone to run a browser. It enables to use the smartphone with cloud technology with the following characteristics : 
<br>
A smart-phone has a recognizable Operating System.<br>
It provides advanced calling i.e. video calling and conferencing features.<br>
Smart-phone must have the capability to run the installable application<br>
Messaging features are available.<br>
A smart-phone must have a persistent and proper internet connection.<br>
2. Mobile Web Services: In Mobile Web Services mobile devices consume more network traffic. It may lead to some challenges for web services such as mismatch of resolution and details of desktop computers. The device needs to know about that service and the way it can be accessed to use any web-service so that the mobile device can transmit specific information about the condition of the device and the user. Enabling Mobile Web Services are as follows: <br>

<br>
Enables web-service systems with web services.<br>
Enables in-built external services.<br>
Enable the rest protocol.<br>
Enables XML-RPC protocols.<br>
Enables the capabilities to authenticate user roles.<br>
