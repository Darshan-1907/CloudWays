Cloud Service Models <br>
Mainly Their are 3 device models in Cloud Computing . Detailed Information of it is explained below ...<br>
<b style="color:skyblue;">
Iaas :- <br></b>
Introduction :- Infrastructure-as-a-Service, commonly referred to as simply “IaaS,” is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the internet, and on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS enables end users to scale and shrink resources on an as-needed basis, reducing the need for high, up-front capital expenditures or unnecessary “owned” infrastructure, especially in the case of “spiky” workloads. In contrast to PaaS and SaaS (even newer computing models like containers and serverless), IaaS provides the lowest-level control of resources in the cloud.
<br>

IaaS emerged as a popular computing model in the early 2010s, and since that time, it has become the standard abstraction model for many types of workloads. However, with the advent of new technologies, such as containers and serverless, and the related rise of the microservices application pattern, IaaS remains foundational but is in a more crowded field than ever. <br>
Architecture:- In an IaaS service model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components that are traditionally present in an on-premises data center. This includes servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.<br>

IaaS providers also supply a range of services to accompany those infrastructure components. These can include the following:
<br>
detailed billing;<br>
monitoring;<br>
log access;<br>
security;<br>
load balancing;<br>
clustering; <br>and<br>
storage resiliency, such as backup, replication and recovery.<br>
These services are increasingly policy-driven, enabling IaaS users to implement greater levels of automation and orchestration for important infrastructure tasks. For example, a user can implement policies to drive load balancing to maintain application availability and performance.<br>
Key features :- costs<br>
IaaS eliminates the cost of configuring and managing a physical datacentre, which makes it a cost-effective choice for migrating to the cloud. The pay-as-you-go subscription models used by IaaS providers help you reduce hardware costs and maintenance and enable your IT team to focus on core business.
<br>
Increases scale and performance of IT workloads
IaaS lets you scale globally and accommodate spikes in resource demand. That way, you can deliver IT resources to employees from anywhere in the world faster and enhance application performance.
<br>
Increases stability, reliability and supportability
With IaaS, there is no need to maintain and upgrade software and hardware or troubleshoot equipment problems. With the appropriate agreement in place,  the service provider assures that your infrastructure is reliable and meets service-level agreements (SLAs).
<br>
Improves business continuity and disaster recovery
Achieving high availability, business continuity and disaster recovery is expensive because it requires a significant amount of technology and staff. But with the right SLA in place, IaaS helps to reduce this cost. It also helps you access applications and data as usual during a disaster or outage.
<br>
Enhances security
With the appropriate service agreement, a cloud service provider can offer better security for your applications and data than the security you would attain in house.
Issues :- Despite its flexible, pay-as-you-go model, IaaS billing can be a problem for some businesses. Cloud billing is extremely granular, and it is broken out to reflect the precise usage of services. It is common for users to experience sticker shock -- or finding costs to be higher than expected -- when reviewing the bills for every resource and service involved in application deployment. Users should monitor their IaaS environments and bills closely to understand how IaaS is being used and to avoid being charged for unauthorized servicesIaaS users are also concerned about service resilience. The workload's availability and performance are highly dependent on the provider. If an IaaS provider experiences network bottlenecks or any form of internal or external downtime, the users' workloads will be affected. In addition, because IaaS is a multi-tenant architecture, the noisy neighbor issue can negatively impact users' workloads.<br>
Uses :- IaaS can be used for a broad variety of purposes. Compute resources that it delivers through a cloud model can be used to fit a variety of use cases. The most common use cases for IaaS deployments include the following:
<br>
Testing and development environments. IaaS offers organizations flexibility when it comes to different test and development environments. They can easily be scaled up or down according to needs.<br>
Hosting customer-facing websites. this can make it more affordable to host a website, compared to traditional means of hosting websites.<br>
Data storage, backup and recovery. IaaS can be the easiest and most efficient way for organizations to manage data when demand is unpredictable or might steadily increase. Furthermore, organizations can circumvent the need for extensive efforts focused on the management, legal and compliance requirements of data storage<br>
Example :-  Popular examples of IaaS include:<br>

DigitalOcean<br>
Linode<br>
Rackspace<br>
Amazon Web Services (AWS)<br>
Cisco Metacloud<br>
Microsoft Azure<br>
Google Compute Engine (GCE)<br>
 
<b style="color: skyblue;">Paas <br></b>
Introduction :-  Cloud platform services, also known as Platform as a Service (PaaS), provide cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. PaaS delivers a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications. All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications.<br>
Key features :- Simple, cost-effective development and deployment of apps<br>
Scalable
Highly available
Developers can customize apps without the headache of maintaining the software
Significant reduction in the amount of coding needed
Automation of business policy
Easy migration to the hybrid model<br>
Issues :- Data security.<br>
 Organizations can run their own apps and services using PaaS solutions, but the data residing in third-party, vendor-controlled cloud servers poses security risks and concerns. Your security options may be limited as customers may not be able to deploy services with specific hosting policies.<br>
Integrations. <br>
The complexity of connecting the data stored within an onsite data center or off-premise cloud is increased, which may affect which apps and services can be adopted with the PaaS offering. Particularly when not every component of a legacy IT system is built for the cloud, integration with existing services and infrastructure may be a challenge.
Vendor lock-in. <br>
Business and technical requirements that drive decisions for a specific PaaS solution may not apply in the future. If the vendor has not provisioned convenient migration policies, switching to alternative PaaS options may not be possible without affecting the business.<br>
Uses :- Utilizing PaaS is beneficial, sometimes even necessary, in several situations. For example, PaaS can streamline workflows when multiple developers are working on the same development project. If other vendors must be included, PaaS can provide great speed and flexibility to the entire process. PaaS is particularly beneficial if you need to create customized applications.
<br>
This cloud service also can greatly reduce costs and it can simplify some challenges that come up if you are rapidly developing or deploying an app.<br>
Example :- Popular examples of PaaS include:<br>
AWS Elastic Beanstalk<br>
Windows Azure<br>
Heroku<br>
Force.com<br>
Google App Engine<br>
OpenShift<br>
<b style="color:blue">Saas :-</b> 
Introduction :- Software as a service (SaaS) is software deployed over the Internet. A provider licenses a SaaS app to customers as an on-demand service, either through a subscription or through a pay-as-you-go model. SaaS can be offered at no charge when there is an opportunity to generate revenue from streams other than the user, such as from advertisement.
<br>
SaaS has become commonplace within most organizations, so it’s important that buyers and users of technology understand what SaaS is and where it’s suitable.<br>
Characteristics:- Following are some defining characteristics of SaaS:<br>
Web access to commercial software<br>
Software managed from a central location<br>
Software delivered in a “one to many” model<br>
Users not required to handle software upgrades and patches<br>
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) makes integration between different pieces of software possible <br>
Issues :- <br>
Interoperability. 
Integration with existing apps and services can be a major concern if the SaaS app is not designed to follow open standards for integration. In this case, organizations may need to design their own integration systems or reduce dependencies with SaaS services, which may not always be possible.<br>
Vendor lock-in. Vendors may make it easy to join a service and difficult to get out of it. For instance, the data may not be portable–technically or cost-effectively–across SaaS apps from other vendors without incurring significant cost or inhouse engineering rework. Not every vendor follows standard APIs, protocols, and tools, yet the features could be necessary for certain business tasks.<br>
Lack of integration support. Many organizations require deep integrations with on-premise apps, data, and services. The SaaS vendor may offer limited support in this regard, forcing organizations to invest internal resources in designing and managing integrations. The complexity of integrations can further limit how the SaaS app or other dependent services can be used.<br>
Uses  :-  SaaS may be the most beneficial option in several situations, including:<br>

Startups or small companies that need to launch ecommerce quickly and don’t have time for server issues or software
Short-term projects that require quick, easy, and affordable collaboration
Applications that aren’t needed too often, such as tax software<br>
Applications that need both web and mobile access<br>
Example :- Popular examples of SaaS include:<br>

Google Workspace (formerly GSuite)<br>
Dropbox<br>
Salesforce<br>
Cisco WebEx<br>
SAP Concur<br>
GoToMeeting<br>
