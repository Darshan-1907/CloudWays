    <br>          <p>  
<br>
<br><br>Cloud Cryptography is encryption that safeguards data stored within the cloud. Several measures are being placed within cloud cryptography which adds a strong layer of protection to secure data to avoid being breached, hacked or affected by malware. Any data hosted by cloud providers are secured with encryption, permitting users to access shared cloud services securely and conveniently. Cloud Cryptography secures sensitive data without delaying the delivery of information.<br>

How does cryptography in the cloud work?<br>
Cloud cryptography is based on encryption, in which computers and algorithms are utilized to scramble text into ciphertext. This ciphertext can then be converted into plaintext through an encryption key, by decoding it with a series of bits. The encryption of data can take place in one of the following ways:
<br>
Pre-encrypted data which is synced with the cloud-<br>
There is software accessible to pre-encrypt it before information gets to the cloud, making it impossible to read for anyone who tries to hack it.<br>
 
End-to-end encryption-<br>
Senders and receivers send messages, whereby they are the only ones who can read them.
 <br>
File encryption-<br>
File encryption occurs when at rest, data is encrypted so that if an unauthorized person tries to intercept a file, they will not be able to access the data it holds. 
 <br>
Full disk encryption-<br>
When any files are saved on an external drive, they will be automatically encrypted. This is the key method to secure hard drives on computers.<br>
How the data on the cloud be secured by Cryptography?<br>
Cloud cryptography brings the same level of security to cloud services by securing data stored with encryption. It can protect sensitive cloud data without delaying data transmission. Many organizations define various cryptographic protocols for their cloud computing to keep a balance between security and efficiency. The cryptography algorithms used for Cloud Security are:
<br>
Symmetric Key Cryptographic Algorithm-<br>
This algorithm gives authentication and authorization to the data because data encrypted with a single unique key cannot be decrypted with any other key. Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are the most popular Symmetric-key Algorithms which are used in cloud computing for cryptography.
 <br>
Asymmetric Key Cryptographic Algorithm-<br>
This algorithm is using two separate different keys for the encryption and decryption process in order to protect the data on the cloud. The algorithms used for cloud computing are Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), RSA and Diffie-Helman Algorithm. 
 <br>
Hashing-<br>
It is mainly used for indexing and recovering items in a database. It also utilizes two separate keys for encrypting and decrypting a message.<br>
Advantages of Cloud Cryptography:
<br>
The data remains private for the users. This reduces cybercrime from hackers.<br>
Organization receive notifications immediately if an unauthorized person tries to make modifications. The users who have cryptographic keys are granted access.<br>
The encryption prevents the data from being vulnerable when the data is being brought over from one computer to another,
Cloud encryption permits organizations to be proactive in their defence against data breaches and cyberattacks and have become a necessity in todayâ€™s data-driven world.<br>
Receivers of the data have the ability to identify if the data received is corrupted, permitting an immediate response and solution to the attack.<br>
Encryption is one of the safest methods to store and transfer the data as it complies with the restrictions imposed by organizations such as FIPS, FISMA, HIPAA or PCI/DSS.<br>
Disadvantages of Cloud Cryptography:<br>
<br>
Cloud cryptography only grants limited security to the data which is already in transit.<br>
It needs highly advanced systems to maintain encrypted data.<br>
The systems must be scalable enough to upgrade which adds to the involved expenses.<br>
Overprotective measures can create difficulties for organizations when recovering data.<br>
