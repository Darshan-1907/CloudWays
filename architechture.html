<br><br>
As we know, cloud computing technology is used by both small and large organizations to store the information in cloud and access it from anywhere at anytime using the internet connection.<br>
Now we will study about its architecture. Cloud computing architecture is divided into the following two parts -<br>
o Front End<br>
o Back End<br>
o Front End<br>
o The front end is used by the client. It contains client-side interfaces and applications that are required to access the cloud computing platforms. The front end includes web servers (including Chrome, Firefox, internet explorer, etc.), thin & fat clients, tablets, and mobile devices.<br>
o Back End<br>
o The back end is used by the service provider. It manages all the resources that are required to provide cloud computing services. It includes a huge amount of data storage, security mechanism, virtual machines, deploying models, servers, traffic control mechanisms, etc.<br>
o There are the following components of cloud computing architecture -<br>
o 1. Client Infrastructure<br>
o Client Infrastructure is a Front end component. It provides GUI (Graphical User Interface)  to interact with the cloud.<br>
o 2. Application<br>
o The application may be any software or platform that a client wants to access.<br>
o 3. Service<br>
o A Cloud Services manages that which type of service you access according to the client’s requirement.<br>
o 4. Runtime Cloud<br>
o Runtime Cloud provides the execution and runtime environment to the virtual machines.<br>
o 5. Storage<br>
o Storage is one of the most important components of cloud computing. It provides a huge amount of storage capacity in the cloud to store and manage data.<br>
o 6. Infrastructure<br>
o It provides services on the host level, application level, and network level. Cloud infrastructure includes hardware and software components such as servers, storage, network devices, virtualization software, and other storage resources that are needed to support the cloud computing model.<br>
o 7. Management<br>
o Management is used to manage components such as application, service, runtime cloud, storage, infrastructure, and other security issues in the backend and establish coordination between them.<br>
o 8. Security<br>
o Security is an in-built back end component of cloud computing. It implements a security mechanism in the back end.
o 9. Internet<br>
o The Internet is medium through which front end and back end can interact and communicate with each other.
APPLICATION<br>
What is a cloud application?<br>
A cloud application, or cloud app, is a software progra<br>m where cloud-based and local components work together. This model relies on remote servers for processing logic that is accessed through a web browser with a continual internet connection.
Cloud application servers typically are located in a remote data center operated by a third-party cloud services infrastructure provider. Cloud-based application tasks may encompass email, file storage and sharing, order entry, inventory management, word processing, customer relationship management (CRM), data collection, or financial accounting features.<br>
Types of cloud computing<br>
There are 4 main types of cloud computing: private clouds, public clouds, hybrid clouds.cloud computing based on two categories deployment model and service model.now we wil speak about deployment model.<br>
Deployment Models <br>
The cloud deployment model identifies the specific type of cloud environment based on ownership, scale, and access, as well as the cloud’s nature and purpose. The location of the servers you’re utilizing and who controls them are defined by a cloud deployment model. It specifies how your cloud infrastructure will look, what you can change, and whether you will be given services or will have to create everything yourself. Relationships between the infrastructure and your users are also defined by cloud deployment types. <br>
Public Cloud<br>
Public cloud is open to all to store and access information via the Internet using the pay-per-usage method.<br>
In public cloud, computing resources are managed and operated by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).<br>
Example: Amazon elastic compute cloud (EC2), IBM SmartCloud Enterprise, Microsoft, Google App Engine, Windows Azure Services Platform.<br>
Private Cloud<br>
Private cloud is also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud. It is used by organizations to build and manage their own data centers internally or by the third party. It can be deployed using Opensource tools such as Openstack and Eucalyptus.<br>
Based on the location and management, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) divide private cloud into the following two parts-<br>
o On-premise private cloud<br>
o Outsourced private cloud<br>
Hybrid Cloud<br>
Hybrid Cloud is a combination of the public cloud and the private cloud. we can say:
Hybrid Cloud = Public Cloud + Private Cloud<br>
Hybrid cloud is partially secure because the services which are ru<br>nning on the public cloud can be accessed by anyone, while the services which are running on a private cloud can be accessed only by the organization's users.<br>
Example: Google Application Suite (Gmail, Google Apps, and Google Drive), Office 365 (MS Office on the Web and One Drive), Amazon Web Services.<br>
Community Cloud<br>
Community cloud allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of several organizations to share the information between the organization and a specific community. It is owned, managed, and operated by one or more organizations in the community, a third party, or a combination of them.<br>
Example: Health Care community cloud<br>
